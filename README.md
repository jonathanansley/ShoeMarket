Project Description:
We are creating a site for sellers of Mens Nike shoes. The site will manage the inventory (shoe types/sizes/quantity) of shoes, msrp, sellers price, profit (sellers price – msrp will calculate profit), clients and their data (name, address, phone, email, etc). The site will also have a history of orders that have taken place, and it’ll update orders that will take place via a form for the seller to fill out.
